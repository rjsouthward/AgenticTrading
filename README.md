## 🧩 Overview

Traditional **Algorithmic Trading (AT)** frameworks decompose the investment workflow into a series of static modules—data preprocessing, signal generation, portfolio optimization, and execution. Each component operates on predefined rules and fixed data flows, limiting adaptability and cross-module learning.

In contrast, **Agentic Trading (AGT)** reframes this process as a multi-agent ecosystem. Each stage of the pipeline is embodied by autonomous agents endowed with reasoning, tool access, and memory. Agents communicate via standardized protocols (e.g., MCP, A2A) and are coordinated through a unified FinAgent Orchestrator. The orchestrator schedules, evaluates, and reflects on agent interactions, supported by a **Memory Agent** that retains historical context and performance logs.

We develop a vertically layered, protocol-oriented architecture for orchestrating autonomous FinAgents in algorithmic trading tasks. It supports real-time decision-making by dynamically composing agents through task-specific execution graphs.

At the entry point, high-level strategic queries are issued via the **Users Query** interface. These are interpreted by the **DAG Planner Agent**, which constructs a directed acyclic graph (DAG) to encode task flow. The **Orchestrator** executes the DAG, coordinating communication and execution across agent pools.

## 🧠 Conceptual Shift — From AT to AGT

| Dimension | Algorithmic Trading | Agentic Trading (Our Framework) |
|-----------|---------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Pipeline Structure** | Linear rule-based modules | Multi-agent graph with contextual interactions |
| **Adaptivity** | Static strategies and parameters | Agents learn and adapt across runs via memory |
| **Optimization Target** | Model-centric (single objective) | System-centric (holistic performance feedback) |
| **Coordination** | Manually configured data flows | Orchestrated via planner and DAG executor |
| **Interpretability** | Post-hoc backtest only | Continuous auditing by Audit and Evaluation Agents |

---

## 🧮 Mapping of Components

| Algorithmic Module | Corresponding Agent in FinAgent |
|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| Research & Strategy Development | Planner and Orchestrator Agents |
| Data Pre-processing | Data Agent Pool |
| Alpha / Risk Modeling | Alpha Agent Pool and Risk Agent Pool |
| Portfolio Construction | Portfolio Construction Agent Pool |
| Execution Model | Execution Agent Pool |
| Backtest / Evaluation | Backtest Agent Pool and Audit Agent Pool |
| Memory / Logging | Memory Agent (Neo4j + vector memory) |

Each agent is a self-contained LLM-powered entity with its own instruction set and tool interfaces. The **Memory Agent** acts as a shared contextual hub—storing task plans, experiment metadata, and agent feedback for continual learning.

## 🏗️ Framework Architecture

The architecture includes the following specialized **Agent Pools**:

### Core Infrastructure

1. **DAG Planner Agent** 
   - Generates dynamic execution plans (DAG) from high-level strategic queries
   - Decomposes complex trading tasks into coordinated agent subtasks
   - Optimizes task scheduling and resource allocation

2. **Orchestrator** 
   - Executes and monitors multi-agent tasks following the DAG plan
   - Coordinates communication across agent pools via protocol layers
   - Manages agent lifecycle, health monitoring, and error recovery

3. **Registration Bus**
   - Maintains agent registration and discovery services
   - Tracks agent health status and availability
   - Facilitates dynamic agent pool scaling

### Functional Agent Pools

4. **Data Agent Pool**
   - Acquires multi-source market data (Polygon.io, Yahoo Finance, custom feeds)
   - Performs data preprocessing, normalization, and quality validation
   - Provides real-time and historical data streams to downstream agents
   - Specializations: `YFinanceAgent`, `PolygonAgent`, `NewsAgent`, `EconAgent`

5. **Alpha Agent Pool**
   - Generates predictive signals and quantitative factors
   - Employs LLM-driven factor mining and hypothesis testing
   - Implements diverse strategies: momentum, mean-reversion, multi-factor models
   - Supports ensemble learning and adaptive window selection via reinforcement learning
   - Specializations: `MomentumAlphaAgent`, `MeanReversionAgent`, `LLMAlphaAgent`, `MultiFactorAlphaAgent`

6. **Risk Agent Pool**

## 🔗 Communication Protocols

The system uses four protocol layers to govern inter-agent communication and coordination:

| Protocol | Full Name | Role |
|----------|-----------|------|
| **MCP** | Multi-agent Control Protocol | Task scheduling, lifecycle control, and DAG execution |
| **ACP** | Agent Communication Protocol | Agent feedback, status reporting, and result synchronization |
| **A2A** | Agent-to-Agent Protocol | Peer-to-peer DAG-executed subtask coordination and direct agent messaging |
| **ANP** | Agent Notification Protocol | Event-driven alerts and system-wide state propagation |

These protocols enable composable, interpretable, and learning-augmented multi-agent orchestration, offering a flexible foundation for intelligent trading strategy research and deployment.

## 🔬 Research Perspective

**Agentic Trading** bridges quantitative finance and cognitive AI. By embedding reasoning and planning capabilities within financial agents, the framework enables:

- **Adaptive Research Loops**: Agents can propose, test, and refine hypotheses autonomously
- **Dynamic Factor Generation**: LLM-driven alpha mining discovers novel predictive signals
- **Continual Strategy Evolution**: Memory-augmented learning allows strategies to improve over time
- **Interpretable Multi-Agent Systems**: DAG-based execution provides transparent decision chains
- **Holistic Performance Optimization**: System-level feedback drives coordination across agent pools

This framework moves beyond the "pipeline automation" paradigm of traditional quantitative finance frameworks (e.g., FinRL, Zipline) toward a **self-improving ecosystem** of agents that can think, learn, and collaborate within market environments.

### Key Research Contributions

1. **Protocol-Oriented Multi-Agent Architecture**: First application of MCP/A2A protocols to quantitative finance
2. **Memory-Augmented Trading Agents**: Neo4j-based contextual memory for long-term strategy learning
3. **DAG-Based Strategy Orchestration**: Dynamic composition of trading workflows via planner agents
4. **LLM-Driven Alpha Discovery**: Automated factor mining using natural language reasoning
5. **Interpretable Agent Coordination**: Auditable decision chains through protocol-level logging
